# Appending events

When you start working with KurrentDB, your application streams are empty. The first meaningful operation is to add one or more events to the database using this API.

## Append your first event

The simplest way to append an event to KurrentDB is to create an `EventData` object and call `appendToStream` method.

```java {38-49}
import io.kurrent.dbclient.AppendToStreamOptions;
import io.kurrent.dbclient.EventData;
import io.kurrent.dbclient.StreamState;

import java.util.UUID;

class OrderPlaced {
    private String orderId;
    private String customerId;
    private double totalAmount;
    private String status;

    public OrderPlaced(String orderId, String customerId, double totalAmount, String status) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.totalAmount = totalAmount;
        this.status = status;
    }

    public String getOrderId() {
        return orderId;
    }

    public String getCustomerId() {
        return customerId;
    }

    public double getTotalAmount() {
        return totalAmount;
    }

    public String getStatus() {
        return status;
    }
}


EventData eventData = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "OrderPlaced",
                new OrderPlaced("order-456", "customer-789", 249.99, "confirmed"))
        .build();

AppendToStreamOptions options = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .streamState(StreamState.noStream());

client.appendToStream("orders", options, eventData)
        .get();

```

`appendToStream` takes a collection or a single object that can be serialized in JSON or binary format, which allows you to save more than one event in a single batch.
 
Outside the example above, other options exist for dealing with different scenarios.

## Working with EventData

Events appended to KurrentDB must be wrapped in an `EventData` object. This allows you to specify the event's content, the type of event, and whether it's in JSON format. In its simplest form, you need three arguments: **eventId**, **eventType**, and **eventData**.

### eventId

This takes the format of a `UUID` and is used to uniquely identify the event you are trying to append. If two events with the same `UUID` are appended to the same stream in quick succession, KurrentDB will only append one of the events to the stream. 

For example, the following code will only append a single event:

```java {3,15-16}
EventData eventData = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "OrderPlaced",
                new OrderPlaced("order-456", "customer-789", 249.99, "confirmed"))
        .build();

AppendToStreamOptions options = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .streamState(StreamState.any());

client.appendToStream("orders", options, eventData)
        .get();

// attempt to append the same event again
client.appendToStream("orders", options, eventData)
        .get();
```

### eventType

Each event should be supplied with an event type. This unique string is used to identify the type of event you are saving. 

It is common to see the explicit event code type name used as the type as it makes serialising and de-serialising of the event easy. However, we recommend against this as it couples the storage to the type and will make it more difficult if you need to version the event at a later date.

### eventData

Representation of your event data. It is recommended that you store your events as JSON objects. This allows you to take advantage of all of KurrentDB's functionality, such as projections. That said, you can save events using whatever format suits your workflow. Eventually, the data will be stored as encoded bytes.

### userMetadata

Storing additional information alongside your event that is part of the event itself is standard practice. This can be correlation IDs, timestamps, access information, etc. KurrentDB allows you to store a separate byte array containing this information to keep it separate.

### contentType

The content type indicates whether the event is stored as JSON or binary format. This is automatically set when using the builder methods like `builderAsJson()` or `builderAsBinary()`.

## Handling concurrency

When appending events to a stream, you can supply a *stream state*. Your client uses this to inform KurrentDB of the state or version you expect the stream to be in when appending an event. If the stream isn't in that state, an exception will be thrown. 

For example, if you try to append the same record twice, expecting both times that the stream doesn't exist, you will get an exception on the second:

```java
EventData eventDataOne = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "OrderPlaced",
                new OrderPlaced("order-456", "customer-789", 249.99, "confirmed"))
        .build();

EventData eventDataTwo = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "OrderPlaced",
                new OrderPlaced("order-457", "customer-789", 249.99, "confirmed"))
        .build();

AppendToStreamOptions options = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .streamState(StreamState.noStream());

client.appendToStream("no-stream-stream", options, eventDataOne)
        .get();

// attempt to append the same event again
client.appendToStream("no-stream-stream", options, eventDataTwo)
        .get();
```

There are several available expected revision options: 
- `StreamState.any()` - No concurrency check
- `StreamState.noStream()` - Stream should not exist
- `StreamState.streamExists()` - Stream should exist
- `StreamState.streamRevision(long revision)` - Stream should be at specific revision

This check can be used to implement optimistic concurrency. When retrieving a
stream from KurrentDB, note the current version number. When you save it back,
you can determine if somebody else has modified the record in the meantime.

First, let's define the event classes for our ecommerce example:

```java
public class PaymentProcessed {
    private String orderId;
    private String paymentId;
    private double amount;
    private String paymentMethod;

    public PaymentProcessed(String orderId, String paymentId, double amount, String paymentMethod) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.paymentId = paymentId;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }
    // getters omitted for brevity
}

public class OrderCancelled {
    private String orderId;
    private String reason;
    private String comment;

    public OrderCancelled(String orderId, String reason, String comment) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.reason = reason;
        this.comment = comment;
    }
    // getters omitted for brevity
}
```

Now, here's how to implement optimistic concurrency control:

```java
ReadStreamOptions readOptions = ReadStreamOptions.get()
        .forwards()
        .fromStart();

ReadResult result = client.readStream("order-12345", readOptions)
        .get();

// Get the current revision to use for optimistic concurrency
long currentRevision = result.getLastStreamPosition();

// Two concurrent operations trying to update the same order
EventData paymentProcessedEvent = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "PaymentProcessed",
                new PaymentProcessed("order-12345", "payment-789", 149.99, "VISA"))
        .build();

EventData orderCancelledEvent = EventData
        .builderAsJson(
                UUID.randomUUID(),
                "OrderCancelled",
                new OrderCancelled("order-12345", "customer-request", "Customer changed mind"))
        .build();

// Process payment (succeeds)
AppendToStreamOptions appendOptions = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .streamState(currentRevision);

WriteResult paymentResult = client.appendToStream("order-12345", appendOptions, paymentProcessedEvent)
        .get();

// Cancel order (fails due to concurrency conflict)
AppendToStreamOptions cancelOptions = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .streamState(currentRevision);

client.appendToStream("order-12345", cancelOptions, orderCancelledEvent)
        .get();
```

## User credentials

You can provide user credentials to append the data as follows. This will override the default credentials set on the connection.

```java
UserCredentials credentials = new UserCredentials("admin", "changeit");

AppendToStreamOptions options = AppendToStreamOptions.get()
        .authenticated(credentials);

client.appendToStream("some-stream", options, eventData)
        .get();
```

## Atomic appends

KurrentDB provides two operations for appending events to one or more streams in a single atomic transaction: `appendRecords` and `multiStreamAppend`. Both guarantee that either all writes succeed or the entire operation fails, but they differ in how records are organized, ordered, and validated.

|                        | `appendRecords`                                                                                                 | `multiStreamAppend`                                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Available since**    | KurrentDB 26.1                                                                                                  | KurrentDB 25.1                                                                                  |
| **Record ordering**    | Interleaved. Records from different streams can be mixed, and their exact order is preserved in the global log. | Grouped. All records for a stream are sent together; ordering across streams is not guaranteed. |
| **Consistency checks** | Decoupled. Can validate the state of any stream, including streams not being written to.                        | Coupled. Expected state is specified per stream being written to.                               |

::: warning
Metadata must be a valid JSON object, using string keys and string values only.
Binary metadata is not supported in this version to maintain compatibility with
KurrentDB's metadata handling. This restriction will be lifted in the next major
release.

### AppendRecords

::: note
This feature is only available in KurrentDB 26.1 and later.
:::

`appendRecords` appends events to one or more streams atomically. Each record specifies which stream it targets, and the exact order of records is preserved in the global log across all streams.

#### Single stream

The simplest usage appends events to a single stream:

```java
EventData eventOne = EventData
        .builderAsJson("OrderPlaced", "{\"orderId\": \"123\"}".getBytes())
        .build();

EventData eventTwo = EventData
        .builderAsJson("OrderShipped", "{\"orderId\": \"123\"}".getBytes())
        .build();

client.appendRecords("order-123", Arrays.asList(eventOne, eventTwo)).get();
```

When no expected state is provided, no consistency check is performed, which is equivalent to `StreamState.any()`.

You can also pass an expected stream state for optimistic concurrency:

```java
client.appendRecords("order-123", StreamState.noStream(), Arrays.asList(eventOne, eventTwo)).get();
```

#### Multiple streams

Use `AppendRecord` to target different streams. Records can be interleaved freely, and the global log preserves the exact order you specify:

```java
List<AppendRecord> records = Arrays.asList(
        new AppendRecord("order-stream", EventData
                .builderAsJson("OrderCreated", "{\"orderId\": \"123\"}".getBytes())
                .build()),
        new AppendRecord("inventory-stream", EventData
                .builderAsJson("ItemReserved", "{\"itemId\": \"abc\", \"quantity\": 2}".getBytes())
                .build()),
        new AppendRecord("order-stream", EventData
                .builderAsJson("OrderConfirmed", "{\"orderId\": \"123\"}".getBytes())
                .build())
);

client.appendRecords(records).get();
```

#### Consistency checks

Consistency checks let you validate the state of any stream, including streams you are not writing to, before the append is committed. All checks are evaluated atomically: if any check fails, the entire operation is rejected and an `AppendConsistencyViolationException` is thrown with details about every failing check and the actual state observed.

```java
List<AppendRecord> records = Collections.singletonList(
        new AppendRecord("order-stream", EventData
                .builderAsJson("OrderConfirmed", "{\"orderId\": \"123\"}".getBytes())
                .build())
);

// ensure the inventory stream exists before confirming the order,
// even though we are not writing to it
List<ConsistencyCheck> checks = Collections.singletonList(
        new ConsistencyCheck.StreamStateCheck("inventory-stream", StreamState.streamExists())
);

client.appendRecords(records, checks).get();
```

Because checks are decoupled from writes, you can validate the state of streams you are not writing to, enabling patterns where a business decision depends on the state of multiple streams but the resulting event is written to only one of them.

### MultiStreamAppend

::: note
This feature is only available in KurrentDB 25.1 and later.
:::

`multiStreamAppend` appends events to one or more streams atomically. Records are grouped per stream using `AppendStreamRequest`, where each request specifies a stream name, an expected state, and the events for that stream.

```java
JsonMapper mapper = new JsonMapper();

Map<String, String> metadata = new HashMap<>();
metadata.put("source", "OrderProcessingSystem");

byte[] metadataBytes = mapper.writeValueAsBytes(metadata);

EventData orderEvent = EventData
        .builderAsJson("OrderCreated", mapper.writeValueAsBytes(new OrderCreated("12345", 99.99)))
        .metadataAsBytes(metadataBytes)
        .build();

EventData inventoryEvent = EventData
        .builderAsJson("ProductPurchased", mapper.writeValueAsBytes(new ProductPurchased("ABC123", 2, 19.99)))
        .metadataAsBytes(metadataBytes)
        .build();

List<AppendStreamRequest> requests = Arrays.asList(
        new AppendStreamRequest(
                "order-stream-1",
                Collections.singletonList(orderEvent).iterator(),
                StreamState.any()
        ),
        new AppendStreamRequest(
                "product-stream-1",
                Collections.singletonList(inventoryEvent).iterator(),
                StreamState.any()
        )
);

MultiStreamAppendResponse result = client.multiStreamAppend(requests.iterator()).get();
```

Each stream can only appear once in the request. The expected state is validated per stream before the transaction is committed.

The result returns the position of the last appended record in the transaction and a collection of responses for each stream.
