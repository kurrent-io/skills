# Persistent Subscriptions

Persistent subscriptions are similar to catch-up subscriptions, but there are two key differences:
- The subscription checkpoint is maintained by the server. It means that when your client reconnects to the persistent subscription, it will automatically resume from the last known position.
- It's possible to connect more than one event consumer to the same persistent subscription. In that case, the server will load-balance the consumers, depending on the defined strategy, and distribute the events to them.

Because of those, persistent subscriptions are defined as subscription groups that are defined and maintained by the server. Consumer then connect to a particular subscription group, and the server starts sending event to the consumer.

You can read more about persistent subscriptions in the [server documentation](@server/features/persistent-subscriptions.md).

## Creating a client

To work with persistent subscriptions, you need to create an instance of the `KurentDBPersistentSubscriptionsClient`. This client is used to manage persistent subscriptions, including creating, updating, and deleting subscription groups.

```cs
await using var client = new KurrentDBPersistentSubscriptionsClient(
	KurrentDBClientSettings.Create("kurrentdb://localhost:2113?tls=false&tlsVerifyCert=false")
);
```

## Creating a Subscription Group

The first step in working with a persistent subscription is to create a subscription group. Note that attempting to create a subscription group multiple times will result in an error. Admin permissions are required to create a persistent subscription group.

The following examples demonstrate how to create a subscription group for a persistent subscription. You can subscribe to a specific stream or to the `$all` stream, which includes all events.

### Subscribing to a Specific Stream

```cs
var settings = new PersistentSubscriptionSettings();
await client.CreateToStreamAsync("order-123", "subscription-group", settings);
```

### Subscribing to `$all`

```cs
var settings = new PersistentSubscriptionSettings();
await client.CreateToAllAsync("subscription-group", StreamFilter.Prefix("user"), settings);
```

::: note
As from EventStoreDB 21.10, the ability to subscribe to `$all` supports
[server-side filtering](subscriptions.md#server-side-filtering). You can create
a subscription group for `$all` similarly to how you would for a specific
stream:

## Connecting a consumer

Once you have created a subscription group, clients can connect to it. A subscription in your application should only have the connection in your code, you should assume that the subscription already exists.

The most important parameter to pass when connecting is the buffer size. This represents how many outstanding messages the server should allow this client. If this number is too small, your subscription will spend much of its time idle as it waits for an acknowledgment to come back from the client. If it's too big, you waste resources and can start causing time out messages depending on the speed of your processing.

### Connecting to one stream

The code below shows how to connect to an existing subscription group for a specific stream:

```cs
await using var subscription = client.SubscribeToStream(
  "order-123",
  "subscription-group",
  cancellationToken: ct
);

await foreach (var message in subscription.Messages) {
  switch (message) {
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.SubscriptionConfirmation(var subscriptionId):
      Console.WriteLine($"Subscription {subscriptionId} to stream started");
      break;
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.Event(var resolvedEvent, _):
      await HandleEvent(resolvedEvent);
      await subscription.Ack(resolvedEvent);
      break;
  }
}
```

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                  |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stream`              | The stream the persistent subscription is on.                                                |
| `groupName`           | The name of the subscription group to subscribe to.                                          |
| `eventAppeared`       | The action to call when an event arrives over the subscription.                              |
| `subscriptionDropped` | The action to call if the subscription is dropped.                                           |
| `bufferSize`          | The number of in-flight messages this client is allowed. **Default: 10**                     |

### Connecting to $all

The code below shows how to connect to an existing subscription group for `$all`:

```cs
await using var subscription = client.SubscribeToAll("subscription-group", cancellationToken: ct);

await foreach (var message in subscription.Messages) {
  switch (message) {
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.SubscriptionConfirmation(var subscriptionId):
      Console.WriteLine($"Subscription {subscriptionId} to stream started");
      break;
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.Event(var resolvedEvent, _):
      await HandleEvent(resolvedEvent);
      break;
  }
}
```

The `SubscribeToAllAsync` method is identical to the `SubscribeToStreamAsync` method, except that you don't need to specify a stream name.

## Acknowledgements

Clients must acknowledge (or not acknowledge) messages in the competing consumer model.

If processing is successful, you must send an Ack (acknowledge) to the server to let it know that the message has been handled. If processing fails for some reason, then you can Nack (not acknowledge) the message and tell the server how to handle the failure.

```cs
await using var subscription = client.SubscribeToStream(
  "test-stream",
  "subscription-group",
  cancellationToken: ct
);

await foreach (var message in subscription.Messages) {
  switch (message) {
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.SubscriptionConfirmation(var subscriptionId):
      Console.WriteLine($"Subscription {subscriptionId} to stream with manual acks started");
      break;
    case PersistentSubscriptionMessage.Event(var resolvedEvent, _):
      try {
        await HandleEvent(resolvedEvent);
        await subscription.Ack(resolvedEvent);
      } catch (UnrecoverableException ex) {
        await subscription.Nack(PersistentSubscriptionNakEventAction.Park, ex.Message, resolvedEvent);
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

The _Nack event action_ describes what the server should do with the message:

| Action    | Description                                                          |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Unknown` | The client does not know what action to take. Let the server decide. |
| `Park`    | Park the message and do not resend. Put it on poison queue.          |
| `Retry`   | Explicitly retry the message.                                        |
| `Skip`    | Skip this message do not resend and do not put in poison queue.      |

## Consumer strategies

When creating a persistent subscription, you can choose between a number of consumer strategies.

### RoundRobin (default)

Distributes events to all clients evenly. If the buffer size is reached, the client won't receive more events until it acknowledges or not acknowledges events in its buffer.

This strategy provides equal load balancing between all consumers in the group.

### DispatchToSingle

Distributes events to a single client until the buffer size is reached. After that, the next client is selected in a round-robin style, and the process repeats.

This option can be seen as a fall-back scenario for high availability, when a single consumer processes all the events until it reaches its maximum capacity. When that happens, another consumer takes the load to free up the main consumer resources.

### Pinned

For use with an indexing projection such as the system `$by_category` projection.

KurrentDB inspects the event for its source stream id, hashing the id to one of 1024 buckets assigned to individual clients. When a client disconnects, its buckets are assigned to other clients. When a client connects, it is assigned some existing buckets. This naively attempts to maintain a balanced workload.

The main aim of this strategy is to decrease the likelihood of concurrency and ordering issues while maintaining load balancing. This is **not a guarantee**, and you should handle the usual ordering and concurrency issues.

## Updating a subscription group

You can edit the settings of an existing subscription group while it is running, you don't need to delete and recreate it to change settings. When you update the subscription group, it resets itself internally, dropping the connections and having them reconnect. You must have admin permissions to update a persistent subscription group.

```cs
var settings = new PersistentSubscriptionSettings(
  resolveLinkTos: true,
  checkPointLowerBound: 20
);

await client.UpdateToStreamAsync("order-123", "subscription-group", settings);
```

## Persistent subscription settings

Both the `Create` and `Update` methods take some settings for configuring the persistent subscription.

The following table shows the configuration options you can set on a persistent subscription.

## Deleting a subscription group

Remove a subscription group with the delete operation. Like the creation of groups, you rarely do this in your runtime code and is undertaken by an administrator running a script.

```cs
try {
  await client.DeleteToStreamAsync("order-123", "subscription-group");
} catch (PersistentSubscriptionNotFoundException) {
  Console.WriteLine("Subscription group does not exist.");
} catch (Exception ex) {
  Console.WriteLine($"Subscription to stream delete error: {ex.GetType()} {ex.Message}");
}
```

| Parameter     | Description                                    |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `stream`      | The stream the persistent subscription is on.  |
| `groupName`   | The name of the subscription group to delete.  |
