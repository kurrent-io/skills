# Projection management

The client provides a way to manage projections in KurrentDB. 

For a detailed explanation of projections, see the [server documentation](@server/features/projections/README.md).

## Creating a client

Projection management operations are exposed through the dedicated client.

```cs
var client = new KurrentDBProjectionManagementClient(
  KurrentDBClientSettings.Create("kurrentdb://localhost:2113?tls=false&tlsVerifyCert=false")
);
```

## Create a projection

Creates a projection that runs until the last event in the store, and then continues processing new events as they are appended to the store. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a projection.
Projections have explicit names, and you can enable or disable them via this name.

```cs
const string js = """
  fromAll()
    .when({
      $init: function() {
        return {
          count: 0
        };
      },
      $any: function(s, e) {
        s.count += 1;
      }
    })
    .outputState();
""";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync("count-events", js);
```

Trying to create projections with the same name will result in an error:

```cs
var name = "count-events";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);
try {
  await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.AlreadyExists) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("Conflict")) { // will be removed in a future release
  var format = $"{name} already exists";
  Console.WriteLine(format);
}
```

## Restart the subsystem

It is possible to restart the entire projection subsystem using the projections management client API. The user must be in the `$ops` or `$admin` group to perform this operation.

```cs
await client.RestartSubsystemAsync();
```

## Enable a projection

Enables an existing projection by name.
Once enabled, the projection will start to process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to enable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

```cs
await client.EnableAsync("$by_category");
```

You can only enable an existing projection. When you try to enable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

 ```cs
try {
  await client.EnableAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Disable a projection

Disables a projection, this will save the projection checkpoint.
Once disabled, the projection will not process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to disable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

```cs
await client.DisableAsync("$by_category");
```

You can only disable an existing projection. When you try to disable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await client.DisableAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Delete a projection

This feature is currently not supported by the client.  

## Abort a projection

Aborts a projection, this will not save the projection's checkpoint.

```cs
await client.AbortAsync("countEvents_Abort");
```

You can only abort an existing projection. When you try to abort a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await client.AbortAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Reset a projection

Resets a projection, which causes deleting the projection checkpoint. This will force the projection to start afresh and re-emit events. Streams that are written to from the projection will also be soft-deleted.

```cs
await client.ResetAsync("countEvents_Reset");
```

Resetting a projection that does not exist will result in an error.

```cs
try {
  await client.ResetAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Update a projection

Updates a projection with a given name. The query parameter contains the new JavaScript. Updating system projections using this operation is not supported at the moment.

```cs
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
      $init: function() {
          return {
              count: 0
          };
      },
      $any: function(s, e) {
          s.count += 1;
      }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, "fromAll().when()");
await client.UpdateAsync(name, js);
```

You can only update an existing projection. When you try to update a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await client.UpdateAsync("Update Not existing projection", "fromAll().when()");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine("'Update Not existing projection' does not exists and can not be updated");
}
```

## List all projections

Returns a list of all projections, user defined & system projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs
var details = client.ListAllAsync();

await foreach (var detail in details)
  Console.WriteLine(
    $@"{detail.Name}, {detail.Status}, {detail.CheckpointStatus}, {detail.Mode}, {detail.Progress}"
  );
```

## List continuous projections

Returns a list of all continuous projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs
var details = client.ListContinuousAsync();
await foreach (var detail in details)
  Console.WriteLine(
    $@"{detail.Name}, {detail.Status}, {detail.CheckpointStatus}, {detail.Mode}, {detail.Progress}"
  );
```

## Get status

Gets the status of a named projection.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs{18}
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(state, event) {
      state.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);

var status = await client.GetStatusAsync(name);

Console.WriteLine(
  $@"{status?.Name}, {status?.Status}, {status?.CheckpointStatus}, {status?.Mode}, {status?.Progress}"
);
```

## Get state

Retrieves the state of a projection.

```cs{20}
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(s, e) {
      s.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = $"count-events";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);

await Task.Delay(500); // give it some time to process and have a state.

var document = await client.GetStateAsync(name);

Console.WriteLine(document.RootElement.GetRawText())
```

or you can retrieve the state as a typed result:

```cs
public class Result {
	public int count { get; set; }

	public override string ToString() => $"count= {count}";
};

var result = await client.GetStateAsync<Result>(name);
```

## Get result

Retrieves the result of the named projection and partition.

```cs{20}
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(s, e) {
      s.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await client.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);

await Task.Delay(500); //give it some time to have a result.

var document = await client.GetResultAsync(name);

Console.WriteLine(document.RootElement.GetRawText())
```

or it can be retrieved as a typed result:

```cs
public class Result {
	public int count { get; set; }

	public override string ToString() => $"count= {count}";
};

var result = await client.GetResultAsync<Result>(name);
```

## Projection Details
